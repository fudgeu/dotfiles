# dotfiles

A collection of my _personal_ dotfiles, that I use on a daily basis

Its honestly pretty functionally minimal, but it is just about everything I need. I might add a systray and maybe some meters showing CPU usage and what not, but thats for another day



These dotfiles are NOT production-ready or anything at all, and will almost 1000% break if you try using them on your own computer. Theres some hard coded values and what not, maybe one day I'll flush it out so it's completley agnostic

You can _try_ to use them! And honestly I _might_ help you out if you do! But... yeah, don't expect this to be a fully featured config

## Tools used

As you can tell from the only four folders that exist in the repo, I've mainly focused on configuring:
- Hyprland (my tiling wayland compositor of choice)
- Rofi (runner/app launcher of choice, specifically [this wayland fork](https://github.com/lbonn/rofi))
- Alacritty (terminal of choice, very lightly customized though)
- Eww (for status bar, workspace switcher, music control UI, extremely minimal control center UI, etc)
